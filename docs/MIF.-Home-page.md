## RPC
RPC with support for marshaling interfaces is a big and interesting topic, but rarely used. This part of the MIF framework is similar to older technologies, such as COM and CORBA. A little more about RPC in MIF you can see in README.md and studying examples. In writing a separate chapter on RPC, I do not see the point.
